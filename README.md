# Winter-Assignment-on-Tour-To-New-York

In this assignment I have tried to build up a sign up page and a login page of my tour planning web application. I have tried to implement the html and css part in it that I learnt after my end term examinations. I have understood that on signing up by an user the data entered will be stored in database. I am currently learning javascript along with mongoDB and it will take me atmax 2 weeks more to have a grip on their fundamentals and to be in a condition to build up a good website.
